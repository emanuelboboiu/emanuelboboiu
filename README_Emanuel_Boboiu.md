- 👋 Hi, I’m @emanuelboboiu from Cluj-Napoca, Romania.
- 👀 I’m interested in application development, especially standalone apps.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing apps in Java for Android, Angular for Single Page Apps, PHP for APIs as back-ends, HTML5 + CSS + JavaScript + PHP + MySQL for websites, C++ for desktop apps and other programming and scripting languages involved.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on useful apps development.
